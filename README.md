# Distrobox Quick Setup | Personal

*Moar containers? üíª*

## Summary

This repo is merely a script I have created to simplify the process of creating some distrobox containers on-the-go so that I can get things up and running quickly. It simply installs some basic packages basic on the distro and copies some configuration files I work with regularly. Currently the *Archlinux* container is the one I rely on the most since it provides all the necessary development packages. The rest are currently meant to be backbones in case something doesn't work, and generally for testing purposes only

‚ö†Ô∏è Some IMPORTANT remarks ‚ö†Ô∏è

- This project is only aimed to suit *my* personal needs, i.e. please do not try to use the installer on your machine
- This project assumes the name of the user is 'pixel' (again, useful for my needs), but it is slowly improving to work with different configurations
- Things may not be working at all times, since I don't typically test the changes I make here thoroughly
- This is an educational project as it helps me get aquainted to bash scripts and other Linux-related things
- This script is always being updated, because I also use it to keep backups of some core configuration files

Again, do NOT expect things to work on your machine if you end up running the script

God bless!
